## Web-Design-Challenge
Web Page Dashboard design and execution

This effort allowed for the development and publication of 7 web pages highlighting our analysis of certain weather data and the Earth'latitude. 

The landing/home page was the starting point for my work. I also made sure each of the pages had an landing link so that browsers could return to the home page at any time. 

HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap were utilized to carry out the assignment. 

I found this assignment more challenging than some previous as the material is all new and much of what we were tasked with seemed only lightly or not at all touched upon. 

I would recommend at least one more class day be spent on web development to add a further depth of understanding to the challenge. 

The side bars and nav bars were trickiest for me as, even with the aid of bootstrap, a fair amount of massaging was required to get the desired look and feel. 

I used the suggested Panda's csv to html, and boot straps table tools to publish the csv file as an HTML table. 

The "gotya's" of this assignment was making sure all links in files pointed to web bases sources. Meaning, no local machine references. That was tricky given that the initial coding and linking referred to local files. 

I tested the published page by sending the link to my wife to be sure it didn't fail due to a local file reference.

Publishing wasn't too difficult, but could have been a bit less daunting with a few more class exercises. 

All-in-all a solid learning endeavor!

May your skies remain sunny (at least when you're on vacation)
